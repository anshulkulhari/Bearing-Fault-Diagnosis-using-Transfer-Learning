# Transfer Learning for Fault Diagnosis 
The detail of WDMAN can be find in the following paper.

[A Deep Transfer Model With Wasserstein Distance Guided Multi-Adversarial Networks for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Different Working Conditions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8713860)

"run_main_TAN.py" is the main program, you can run this text by:
```
python run_main_TAN.py
```

or you can change the paremeter and run:
```
python run_main_TAN.py --epoch 10000 learning_rate 0.001
```





Issues:
  1. "Load failed" is a note, not a bug, you can run this code normally.
  2. The "TypeError: can't pickle FlagValues" problem has been solved.
